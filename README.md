# Advanced-Vulnerability-Scanner

## Description
The **Advanced Vulnerability Scanner** is a Python-based tool designed to identify common security vulnerabilities in web applications. It focuses primarily on SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, utilizing a set of predefined payloads to test the security of specified endpoints. This scanner can be particularly useful for developers, security professionals, and penetration testers who want to assess the security posture of their web applications.

## Features
- **SQL Injection Detection**: Checks for various SQL injection vulnerabilities using a comprehensive list of payloads.
- **XSS Detection**: Identifies both reflected and stored XSS vulnerabilities by injecting malicious scripts into web application inputs.
- **Endpoint Crawling**: Automatically crawls the specified base URL to discover additional endpoints that may not be explicitly listed.
- **HTML Report Generation**: Creates a detailed HTML report summarizing any vulnerabilities found during the scan.

## Usage
To use the Advanced Vulnerability Scanner, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-vulnerability-scanner.git
   cd advanced-vulnerability-scanner

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4

3. **Run the Scanner**:
   ```bash
   python scanner.py

4. **Review the Report**:

   After the scan completes, an HTML report named vulnerability_report.html will be generated in the same directory. Open this file in a web browser to review any 
   vulnerabilities detected.

## Example

Enter the base URL of the website to scan: http://example.com

## Customization

You can modify the initial list of endpoints in the script by changing the initial_endpoints variable. Add or remove endpoints based on your specific testing requirements.

## Important Notes
- **Ethical Use**:
This tool is intended for ethical hacking and security assessment purposes only. Ensure you have permission to test any website you scan.
- **Limitations**:
While this scanner covers common vulnerabilities, it may not find all possible security issues. Consider using additional tools and techniques for comprehensive security assessments.
